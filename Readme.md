## GitHub Re-creation

1. Recreate your github page, the [repos tab specifically](https://github.com/twhitacre)
2. No functionality (search bar, sorting, tabs) needs to be built in
3. It should match as closely as possible. This will be a great portfolio piece

> Try to match things as closely as possible. You will need to use all of the API's listed below and will need to write your own functions to calculate some of the information. As for where to start, I would get a layout up and running, then work on getting your data to the page, then work on the fine styling details. You have 2 days to do this, so pace yourself. Set goals and keep moving.

## Deliverables

1. Please comment on the assignment with a link to this pushed to GH Pages
2. Please comment on the assignment with a link to your repo
